      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I live life with one phrase in mind: "Where there is a will, there is a way". If you truly want something bad enough and if focus your entire being on achieving it, you will.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing basketball, going on scenic drives and having a solid gaming session with my mates. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>After a few years in Web Development, I would like to progress into the general field of AI and Machine Learning and explore research options there. I am very excited about the ways in which new research in that area is drastically changing our day-to-day lives right this minute.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the South-Eastern suburbs of Melbourne</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find Web Development to be almost the perfect balance between soul-freeing art and rigorous, planned execution - creating a website that is visually inviting and immersive but at the same time, goal-oriented and efficient. When I was in university, I was involved in marketing my family business with my parents and through this, I discovered Web Development. I was deeply involved in the discussions with the web developers who helped us create our website and this helped me realise that I had a keen interest in doing the same work myself.</p>
